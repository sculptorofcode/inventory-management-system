### **Inventory Management System (IMS) Overview**

The **Inventory Management System (IMS)** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline the management of products, orders, suppliers, and payments for businesses of any size. The system ensures efficient tracking of inventory, simplifies order processing, and provides real-time access to data for customers, suppliers, and business managers. With a focus on automation and transparency, IMS helps businesses maintain optimal stock levels, reduce errors, and enhance customer satisfaction.

#### Key Modules:

1. **User Authentication & Roles:**
   The IMS uses role-based access, ensuring that different types of users — such as customers, suppliers, and managers — can log in with unique credentials. Each user role is granted access to specific functionalities of the system, ensuring secure and controlled access to data.

2. **Customer Management:**
   Customers can register with the system, providing necessary details like contact information, shipping address, and payment preferences. Once registered, customers can browse the available inventory, place orders, and view their order history.

3. **Supplier Management:**
   Suppliers play a key role in managing inventory. They can log in to the system, add or update product information, and track their sales orders. This ensures that suppliers keep their product listings up-to-date, helping businesses avoid stock shortages or overstocking.

4. **Product Management:**
   The system enables suppliers or inventory managers to add and manage products in the inventory, including details such as product name, category, purchase price, selling price, and available quantity. The platform helps track product stock levels in real-time, ensuring that businesses are aware of any low-stock alerts.

5. **Purchase Orders:**
   Customers can place purchase orders by selecting products from the catalog. Once an order is placed, it is logged into the system, allowing the customer to track the order's status — from pending and confirmed to shipped or delivered.

6. **Sales Orders:**
   After a customer places an order, the supplier confirms the order and manages fulfillment through the sales order module. The sales order status can be updated to reflect progress, ensuring seamless communication between the supplier and customer.

7. **Payment Processing:**
   IMS simplifies payment tracking. Customers can choose their preferred payment method (credit card, bank transfer, etc.), and once payment is confirmed, the order status is updated. The system logs all payment transactions, helping businesses keep track of customer payments and outstanding balances.

8. **Reporting & Analytics:**
   The system generates various reports for inventory managers. Reports include customer details, product stock levels, sales orders, purchase orders, and supplier performance. These reports provide insights into stock trends, financial transactions, and supplier reliability, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
