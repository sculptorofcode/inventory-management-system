4. Check that values are different (unless all purchases were at same price)

#### ‚úÖ Inventory Control Models  
1. Select a product
2. Set Lead Time (e.g., 7 days)
3. Set Ordering Cost (e.g., $50)
4. Set Holding Cost (e.g., 20%)
5. Click "Calculate EOQ & ROP"
6. Verify EOQ and ROP values appear

#### ‚úÖ Financial Calculations
1. Select date range (e.g., last 12 months)
2. Optionally select specific product
3. Click "Generate Financial Report"
4. Verify turnover ratio, margin, and ROI appear

#### ‚úÖ Demand Forecasting
1. Select a product with sales history
2. Click "Generate Forecast"
3. Verify forecast values and recommendations appear

#### ‚úÖ ABC Analysis
1. Click "Run ABC Analysis"
2. Verify products are classified into A, B, C categories
3. Check that percentages add up to 100%

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No products found"
**Solution**: Ensure you have active products in your database
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Issue: "No purchase history"
**Solution**: Add some purchase data or check table names
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchase_details;
```

### Issue: "Division by zero" errors
**Solution**: Ensure products have non-zero prices and quantities

### Issue: "Function not found" errors
**Solution**: Check that all function files are included:
- `inventory_valuation_functions.php`
- `inventory_control_functions.php`  
- `financial_calculations_functions.php`
- `demand_forecasting_functions.php`

### Issue: Dashboard not loading
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify jQuery and other libraries are loading
3. Check file permissions

## üìù Sample Data for Testing

If you need sample data for testing, here are some SQL commands to create realistic scenarios:

### Add Sample Purchase Data
```sql
-- Sample purchases for different dates and prices
INSERT INTO purchase_details (product_id, quantity, unit_cost, purchase_date) VALUES
(1, 100, 10.00, '2023-01-15'),
(1, 150, 12.00, '2023-02-20'),
(1, 200, 11.50, '2023-03-10'),
(1, 120, 13.00, '2023-04-05');

-- Repeat for other products with different values
```

### Add Sample Sale Data  
```sql
-- Sample sales for turnover calculations
INSERT INTO sale_details (product_id, quantity, unit_price, sale_date) VALUES
(1, 80, 15.00, '2023-01-25'),
(1, 90, 16.00, '2023-02-28'),
(1, 110, 15.50, '2023-03-20'),
(1, 85, 17.00, '2023-04-15');
```

## üéØ Key Performance Indicators to Monitor

After setup, regularly monitor these metrics:

### Daily Monitoring

### Weekly Monitoring  
- **Inventory Turnover**: Track for performance trends
- **ABC Classification**: Review for category changes

### Monthly Monitoring
- **Financial Metrics**: ROI, gross margins, carrying costs
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Compare predictions vs. actual sales

## üìà Best Practices for Implementation

### Data Quality
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep product data current
2. **Accurate Costs**: Ensure purchase costs are properly recorded
3. **Complete History**: Maintain comprehensive transaction records

### User Training
1. **Manager Training**: Focus on interpretation of metrics
2. **Staff Training**: Emphasize data entry accuracy
3. **Regular Reviews**: Monthly training on new features

### System Maintenance
1. **Backup Data**: Regular database backups
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track calculation speeds
3. **Update Parameters**: Adjust EOQ and forecasting parameters based on business changes

## üîç Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Calculation Parameters

#### EOQ Calculations
- **Ordering Cost**: Adjust based on actual procurement costs
- **Holding Cost**: Typically 15-25% of item value annually
- **Lead Time**: Update based on supplier performance

#### Forecasting Settings
- **Historical Periods**: Use 12-24 months for stable products
- **Smoothing Factors**: Adjust alpha (0.1-0.3) for different sensitivities
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Consider implementing for seasonal products

#### ABC Analysis Thresholds
- **A Items**: Typically top 80% of value (adjust as needed)
