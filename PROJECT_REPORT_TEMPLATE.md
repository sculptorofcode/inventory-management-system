## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Inventory Management Systems Evolution
Inventory management systems have changed a lot over time. In the past, businesses used paper records, which were slow and often had mistakes. With computers in the 1980s, tracking inventory became faster and more accurate, but these systems were not always connected to other business tools. Today, inventory management uses web and cloud technologies, making it easy to connect with sales, supply chain, and finance. Studies show that real-time tracking and automation help reduce running out of stock or having too much inventory. Still, there are challenges like keeping data safe, making sure the system can grow, and getting people to use new tools. New trends include using smart devices and data analysis to make inventory management even better.

### 2.2 Web-based Applications in Business
Web-based applications have transformed business process automation by enabling real-time access, collaboration, and integration across departments. Early business software was often desktop-based and limited to local networks, making data sharing and remote access difficult. With the rise of web technologies, businesses can now automate workflows such as inventory tracking, order processing, and reporting through centralized platforms accessible from anywhere. Studies highlight that web-based solutions improve efficiency, reduce manual errors, and support scalability as organizations grow. Security, user adoption, and integration with legacy systems remain important considerations. Recent trends include the use of cloud computing, APIs, and responsive interfaces to further streamline business operations and enhance user experience.

### 2.3 Database Design Principles

A well-designed database is essential for a reliable inventory system. The IMS database uses these key principles:

**Normalization:**
- Data is organized to avoid repetition and ensure each piece of information is stored only once.
- Tables are split so that each one has a clear purpose (e.g., products, suppliers, orders).

**Entity Relationships:**
- Tables are linked using foreign keys, so related data stays connected (e.g., each order links to a customer or supplier).

**Referential Integrity:**
- Foreign key rules prevent orphaned records and keep data consistent when changes happen.

**Indexes:**
- Primary keys and indexes make searching and joining tables faster.

**Naming Conventions:**
- Table and column names are clear and consistent, making the database easy to understand.

**Audit and Tracking:**
- Change logs and timestamps help track updates and maintain accountability.

**Data Integrity:**
- Constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and ENUM make sure only valid data is stored.

These principles help the IMS database stay organized, efficient, and easy to maintain.

### 4.2 Database Design

#### 4.2.1 Entity Relationship Diagram

```
+----------------+      +-------------------+      +------------------+
|  tbl_products  |<-----|  tbl_stock        |----->| tbl_warehouse    |
+----------------+      +-------------------+      +------------------+
        ^                       |   ^                       ^
        |                       |   |                       |
        |                       |   |                       |
+----------------+      +-------------------+      +----------------------+
| tbl_suppliers  |<-----| tbl_stock_transactions |-->| tbl_warehouse_location |
+----------------+      +-------------------+      +----------------------+
        ^                       ^
        |                       |
        |                       |
+----------------+      +-------------------+
| tbl_customers  |      |   (other tables)  |
+----------------+      +-------------------+
```

**Legend:**
- Arrows (`<-----` or `----->`) indicate foreign key relationships.
- `tbl_stock` links products, warehouses, and tracks batch numbers.
- `tbl_stock_transactions` records stock movement, referencing products, suppliers, customers, and warehouse locations.

**Entity Relationships:**
- Each `tbl_stock` record references one product (`tbl_products`) and one warehouse (`tbl_warehouse`).
- Each `tbl_stock_transactions` record references:
  - One product (`tbl_products`)
  - One supplier (`tbl_suppliers`) or one customer (`tbl_customers`) depending on transaction type
  - One warehouse (`tbl_warehouse`)
  - One warehouse location (`tbl_warehouse_location`)
- Each `tbl_warehouse_location` belongs to one warehouse (`tbl_warehouse`).
- Each `tbl_stock` record may reference a warehouse location (`tbl_warehouse_location`) for precise tracking.
- Suppliers (`tbl_suppliers`) and customers (`tbl_customers`) are linked to transactions but not directly to stock.

#### 4.2.2 Database Schema
Key tables:
- `tbl_products` - Product information
- `tbl_stock` - Stock tracking with batch numbers
- `tbl_suppliers` - Supplier management
- `tbl_customers` - Customer information
- `tbl_stock_transactions` - Stock movement history
- `tbl_warehouse` - Warehouse management
- `tbl_warehouse_location` - Location tracking

#### 4.2.3 Normalization
The database for the IMS project is designed to follow Third Normal Form (3NF). This means:

- **Each table contains data about a single entity** (e.g., products, suppliers, customers).
- **All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key** (no partial dependencies).
- **There are no transitive dependencies**; non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes.

By applying 3NF, the database eliminates redundant data, reduces the risk of anomalies during insert, update, or delete operations, and ensures data integrity. For example, supplier details are stored only in the `tbl_suppliers` table and referenced via foreign keys, rather than being duplicated in product or transaction tables. This structure makes the database efficient, consistent, and easy to maintain as the system grows.

## 6. Mathematical Formulas and Calculations

### 6.1 Inventory Valuation Methods

#### 6.1.1 Weighted Average Cost (WAC)
```
WAC = (Cost of Goods Available for Sale) / (Units Available for Sale)

Where:
Cost of Goods Available = Opening Stock Value + Purchases
Units Available = Opening Stock Units + Purchased Units
```

**Implementation in System:**
```php
function calculateWAC($productId) {
    $openingValue = getOpeningStockValue($productId);
    $purchaseValue = getPurchaseValue($productId);
    $openingUnits = getOpeningStockUnits($productId);
    $purchaseUnits = getPurchaseUnits($productId);
    
    return ($openingValue + $purchaseValue) / ($openingUnits + $purchaseUnits);
}
```

#### 6.1.2 First In, First Out (FIFO)
```
Cost of Goods Sold = Cost of Oldest Inventory First
Ending Inventory = Cost of Most Recent Purchases
```

#### 6.1.3 Last In, First Out (LIFO)
```
Cost of Goods Sold = Cost of Most Recent Purchases First
Ending Inventory = Cost of Oldest Inventory
```

### 6.2 Inventory Control Models

#### 6.2.1 Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
```
EOQ = √(2DS/H)

Where:
D = Annual Demand
S = Ordering Cost per Order
H = Holding Cost per Unit per Year
```

**System Implementation:**
```php
function calculateEOQ($annualDemand, $orderingCost, $holdingCost) {
    return sqrt((2 * $annualDemand * $orderingCost) / $holdingCost);
}
```

#### 6.2.2 Reorder Point (ROP)
```
ROP = (Average Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

Safety Stock = Z × σ × √LT

Where:
Z = Z-score for desired service level
σ = Standard deviation of demand
LT = Lead Time
```

#### 6.2.3 Total Inventory Cost
```
Total Cost = Purchase Cost + Ordering Cost + Holding Cost

Purchase Cost = D × C
Ordering Cost = (D/Q) × S
Holding Cost = (Q/2) × H × C

Where:
C = Cost per unit
Q = Order quantity
```

### 6.3 Financial Calculations

#### 6.3.1 Inventory Turnover Ratio
```
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Average Inventory = (Opening Inventory + Closing Inventory) / 2
```

#### 6.3.2 Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
```
DSO = (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365
```

#### 6.3.3 Gross Profit Margin
```
Gross Profit Margin = ((Sales Revenue - COGS) / Sales Revenue) × 100
```

### 6.4 Demand Forecasting

#### 6.4.1 Moving Average
```
Moving Average = (Sum of n previous periods) / n
```

#### 6.4.2 Exponential Smoothing
```
Ft+1 = α × At + (1-α) × Ft

Where:
Ft+1 = Forecast for next period
α = Smoothing constant (0 < α < 1)
At = Actual demand in current period
Ft = Forecast for current period
```

### 6.5 ABC Analysis Classification

#### 6.5.1 Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
```
A Items: Top 20% of items representing 80% of total value
B Items: Next 30% of items representing 15% of total value
C Items: Remaining 50% of items representing 5% of total value

Value = Annual Usage × Unit Cost
```

**System Implementation:**
```php
function performABCAnalysis($products) {
    // Calculate annual value for each product
    $productValues = [];
    foreach ($products as $product) {
        $annualUsage = getAnnualUsage($product['id']);
        $unitCost = $product['cost'];
        $productValues[] = [
            'id' => $product['id'],
            'value' => $annualUsage * $unitCost
        ];
    }
    
    // Sort by value descending
    usort($productValues, function($a, $b) {
        return $b['value'] - $a['value'];
    });
    
    // Classify products
    $totalValue = array_sum(array_column($productValues, 'value'));
    $cumulativeValue = 0;
    
    foreach ($productValues as &$product) {
        $cumulativeValue += $product['value'];
        $percentage = ($cumulativeValue / $totalValue) * 100;
        
        if ($percentage <= 80) {
            $product['class'] = 'A';
        } elseif ($percentage <= 95) {
            $product['class'] = 'B';
        } else {
            $product['class'] = 'C';
        }
    }
    
    return $productValues;
}
```

### 11.2 Cost Estimation using Basic COCOMO Model

The Basic COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is used to estimate the effort, development time, and cost based on the project's estimated size in thousands of lines of code (KLOC).

#### 11.2.1 Project Classification
The Inventory Management System falls under the **Semi-detached** mode in the COCOMO classification:
- **Semi-detached mode**: Medium-sized projects with mixed team experience and moderate project constraints

#### 11.2.2 COCOMO Parameters for Semi-detached Mode
- a = 3.0 (coefficient)
- b = 1.12 (exponent)
- c = 2.5 (coefficient for time calculation)
- d = 0.35 (exponent for time calculation)

#### 11.2.3 Effort and Schedule Calculation
For the Inventory Management System with an estimated 20 KLOC (thousand lines of code):

```
Effort = a × (KLOC)^b
Effort = 3.0 × (20)^1.12
Effort = 3.0 × 27.22
Effort = 81.66 Person-Months

Development Time = c × (Effort)^d
Development Time = 2.5 × (81.66)^0.35
Development Time = 2.5 × 4.29
Development Time = 10.73 Months
```

#### 11.2.4 Cost Calculation based on COCOMO
Using an average monthly cost of ₹58,000 per person (derived from human resource costs):

```
Total Cost = Effort × Average Monthly Cost
Total Cost = 81.66 Person-Months × ₹58,000
Total Cost = ₹47,36,280
```

#### 11.2.5 Comparison with Traditional Estimation
| Estimation Method | Estimated Cost (₹) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Traditional Estimation (Hardware + Software + HR) | 22,00,000 |
| COCOMO Estimation | 47,36,280 |
